Hey everyone, 
As an Epitech software engineering student with a knack for front-end and back-end development, I specialize in ReactJS, NodeJS, and Express, and am currently exploring Three.js and VR. Eager to deepen my JS and React skills, I'm open to collaborating on Node.js back-end projects. Reach out at @sharlyslgt@gmail.com.
